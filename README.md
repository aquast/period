# FileFormats as periodic system

This is an - currently static - webpresentation of file formats with information about long term availibility of this formats. 
Until now I wasn't able to provide any database backend. A suggestion form for additional file formats would be fine but is recently out of scope for me. 

Aim is is to present information about file formats qualification for long term preservation in a nice, neat and easy to use way.
