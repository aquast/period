# FileFormats as periodic system

This is an - actual currently only static - webpresentation of file formats with information about long term availibility of this formats. 
Until now I wasn't able to provide database backend and a suggesting form for additional formats. 

Intention is to present information about file formats qualification for long term preservation in a nice, neat and easy to use way.
